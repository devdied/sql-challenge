# SQL Database Design and Analysis for Pewlett Hackard

## Project Overview

This project involves data engineering and analysis tasks to explore historical employee data from the 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company. We will create a SQL database schema based on the provided CSV files, import the data, and perform various data analyses to answer specific questions.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main phases:

1. **Data Modeling:** In this phase, we create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the structure and relationships of the tables.

2. **Data Engineering:** We design the SQL table schemas for the six CSV files, specifying data types, constraints, and relationships. We then import the data into the respective SQL tables.

3. **Data Analysis:** SQL queries are used to analyze the data and extract insights. We answer a series of questions related to employee information.

## Directory Structure

- **Data_Modeling:** Contains the ERD diagram as an image or document.
- **Data_Engineering:** Includes SQL scripts for table schema creation and data import.
- **Data_Analysis:** Contains SQL queries and results for data analysis.

## Project Deliverables

- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- SQL scripts for table schema creation and data import
- SQL queries and results for data analysis

## Project Outcome

This project showcases our data engineering and SQL skills in designing a database, importing real-world data, and extracting valuable insights. The results of our data analysis will provide a deeper understanding of Pewlett Hackard's historical workforce, aiding in HR decisions and reporting.
